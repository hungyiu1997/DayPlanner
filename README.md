This is once again a challenging assignment for me. I guess good things take time and I have implemented some changes into my studying routine. Recently, I have built pretty good relationships with some of my classmates. Hopefully we can cheer each other on and share some study tips with each other. I understand this is not the usual content for a readMe file but this gives me some update on my progress in the class. I dedicated a lot of hours in studying. However, it is still frustrating for me that I am having such difficulties in the homework. I have absolutely hit a wall when we entered the JavaScripts unit. I know both Manoli and professor had warned us about JavaScript but I did not expect to stall so much. As I was redoing class excercises and during the homework, I realize the best I could do was to stare at the page. it wasn't until I got help from the tutor and from Professor Joe that I could begin my homework assignments. I went to two help sessions with Professor Joe. The normal half hour quick session ran overtime as he had to practically lay out the whole assignment for me. It makes me realize that whatever progress I thought I made was not really progress at all. At the end of the day, the only way to get through is keep beating on, watching the Udemy cources and continue practicing on the assignments.
